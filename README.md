# ReactHooks-vs-Class-Components

This code is written in React and focuses on comparing the use of state Hooks (useState) and classes (Component) to implement a simple security code validation functionality. Here's a description of what the code does and some methods and procedures involved:

Imports: The code begins with necessary imports of React and related components.

UseState Component:

The UseState component receives a prop called name.
Within this component, React's state Hooks (useState) are used to manage two states: error and loading.
A effect (useEffect) is used to simulate a 3-second validation process, triggered when the loading state changes.
If loading is true, a "Loading..." message is displayed.
If error is true, an "Error: Incorrect code" message is displayed.
There's an input field to enter the security code and a button to initiate validation.
When the button is clicked, the loading state is set to true, triggering the effect.
ClassState Component:

The ClassState component is a class that receives the same name prop as the UseState component.
It has an internal state error initialized to false.
In the render method, a request for a security code is displayed, and if error is true, the error message is displayed.
There's an input field and a button similar to the UseState component.
When the button is clicked, the error state is toggled, alternating between true and false.
Methods and Procedures:

State Hooks (useState):

React.useState(initialState): This hook is used to declare state in a functional component. It returns an array with the state value and a function to update it.
React.useEffect(effectFunction, dependencies): This hook allows performing side effects in a functional component. It runs after rendering. The effectFunction is the code that runs, and dependencies is an array specifying which variables must change for the effect to re-run.
Class Component (Component):

constructor(props): React class constructor where initial states are set up and properties are configured.
render(): Mandatory method in a React class that defines the component's structure based on its state and props.
Event Handling: Events, such as button clicks, are handled by assigning functions to event attributes like onClick.
State Toggling:

In both components, a function is used to change the state (setLoading in UseState and this.setState in ClassState) when the button is clicked. This triggers re-rendering of the component and execution of effects or UI changes based on the new state.
In summary, this code illustrates how to implement a simple validation functionality using both state Hooks (useState) in a functional component and classes (Component) in a class component. Both approaches achieve similar results, but state Hooks are more modern and provide a more concise way to manage state in functional components.
